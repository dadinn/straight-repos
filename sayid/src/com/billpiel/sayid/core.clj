;; === Query functions

(def query-docs
  "There are several querying functions. Many of them take a variadic
  `body` argument. The syntax of the `body` argument is described
  below:

  Body may or may not begin with a keyword. If it doesn't, body is one
  or more vectors which specify a query.

  If it does being with a keyword, the syntax rules of that keyword
  apply to the args that follow. The keyword acts as a modifier that
  expands the query results to include nodes that have a specified type
  of relationship with any nodes matching the query. The modifiers are
  listed here:

  :a -- returns ancestors of matching nodes
  :d -- returns descendants of matching nodes
  :s -- returns siblings of matching nodes
  :w -- wildcard! returns ancestors, descendants and siblings of matching nodes
  :r -- range; takes exactly two query vectors and returns nodes that
        are both descendants of the first and ancestors of the second

  Additionally, the keywords :a, :d, :s and :w take an optional numeric
  argument which precedes the vector queries. This number specifies a
  limit on the number of relative hops that will be taken.

  A query clause may be a vector or a symbol. A vector is applied in a
  `get-in` fashion to each trace node, with the final element acting as
  a matching value or predicate function. If the final value is truthy,
  the node is included in the query result set. For example, a `body` of

  :a 2 [:arg-map 'fruit :apple]

  would match any trace node where an argument `fruit` took a
  value :apple, as well as the parent and grandparent of that node.

  If the query is a symbol instead of a vector, the query will match any
  node whose function name matches the symbol. For example, a `body` of

  somefunc

  is equivalent to: [:name 'somefunc]
